# GitHub Actions Cancel

## Overview

The GitHub Actions Cancel project was initiated to address the lack of automatic cancelation support in GitHub Actions. This utility serves as a webhook that monitors running GitHub Actions instances and ensures that only the latest job for a given branch is allowed to proceed.


## Purpose

GitHub Actions do not natively support automatic cancelation of redundant or outdated jobs. This project aims to enhance workflow efficiency by automatically canceling previous jobs, allowing only the most recent one to continue execution.

## Technology Stack

The application is implemented in the Go programming language (Golang), leveraging its performance and simplicity. Additionally, the project is designed to be deployable on AWS Lambda, offering a serverless and scalable solution.
